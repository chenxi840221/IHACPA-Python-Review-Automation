# Changelog

All notable changes to the IHACPA Python Package Review Automation project will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-09 - Date Published Logic Fix & "Not Available" Feature

### 🚀 Major Enhancements
- **Fixed Date Published Logic**: Column E now correctly shows publication date for current/installed version instead of latest version
- **"Not Available" Feature**: When PyPI version links are not accessible, shows "Not Available" with red background
- **Enhanced Version-Specific API**: Improved fallback mechanism for missing version data
- **Color Highlighting Enhancement**: Added red highlighting for "Not Available" fields

### 🔧 Technical Fixes
- **Version String Conversion**: Fixed numeric version handling (float/int to string conversion)
- **Always Try Version-Specific API**: Enhanced fallback mechanism that always attempts version-specific endpoints
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better handling of missing versions in PyPI releases data
- **Prevented Latest Version Fallback**: Date Published never uses Latest Version Release Date as fallback

### 🎯 Specific Package Issues Resolved
- **pytz v2022.7**: Now correctly shows `2022-12-18` (current version date) instead of `2025-03-25` (latest version date)
- **PyYAML v6**: Now correctly shows "Not Available" (red background) since version doesn't exist
- **PyQt5 v5.15.7**: Properly processes with correct date extraction
- **PyQtWebEngine v5.15.4**: Properly processes with correct date extraction
- **ruamel.yaml v0.17.21**: Properly processes with correct date extraction

### 🎨 Visual Improvements
- **Enhanced Color Scheme**: Added bright red background for "Not Available" fields
- **Updated Documentation**: Comprehensive updates to README.md and USAGE_GUIDE.md explaining new logic

### 📋 Logic Changes
#### Before Fix:
- Date Published often showed latest version dates (incorrect)
- Failed to retrieve dates for some packages due to API limitations
- No clear indication when version data was unavailable

#### After Fix:
- Date Published correctly shows current/installed version dates
- "Not Available" displayed with red highlighting when PyPI version links fail
- Enhanced API fallback mechanism catches more edge cases
- Never uses Latest Version Release Date as fallback for Date Published

### 🧪 Test Results
- **pytz v2022.7**: ✅ Fixed - Shows correct current version date (2022-12-18)
- **PyYAML v6**: ✅ Fixed - Shows "Not Available" (version doesn't exist)
- **PyQt5 v5.15.7**: ✅ Working - Processes correctly
- **PyQtWebEngine v5.15.4**: ✅ Working - Processes correctly
- **ruamel.yaml v0.17.21**: ✅ Working - Processes correctly
