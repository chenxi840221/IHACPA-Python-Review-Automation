Pypypi.org and pull up the information about that particular package. So what we're doing, So what I'm doing as far as so working from left to right, we open that one up. We can see. Yes, that's correct.
Project Lead 0 minutes 22 seconds
We're may. I'm making a note of the date when the package was released because because what we're actually finding some of these packages are actually rather old. And as you can sort of see this one was released in 2022. Now that doesn't mean to say that that's so there's packages here like for example.
Project Lead 0 minutes 41 seconds
One here was released in 2018. That's not the end of the world, but that was the last release of it. So what we're looking for is cut the current date of the current install and then when we go to the, you'll see here in this red box.
Project Lead 0 minutes 56 seconds
Here there's a newer version available and what I'm doing here is noting the the newer version and putting it in the latest version and then that link here gets updated and this is a sanity check to make sure we get the right link and it comes up saying latest version.
Project Lead 1 minute 16 seconds
Which is good, and I'll note the date down.
Project Lead 1 minute 20 seconds
The 3rd of June 25, I'll grab some additional detail about the package. So for example, under requires, you'll see Python 9, but rather than copy paste it, I've already got. Just grab them from the spreadsheet because that's nicely formatted and the other thing we look here.
Project Lead 1 minute 39 seconds
Used for the development status, which so again I've tried to make sure all of this is self-explanatory so so then we can go for obviously a lot of them are usually production stable, but in this particular case we're looking for 4 beta.
Project Lead 1 minute 59 seconds
Which we have one here and copy and paste that in there. Then what we do then what it would do is we look for the GitHub link.
Project Lead 2 minutes 9 seconds
More often than not, as under the homepage link on here.
Project Lead 2 minutes 15 seconds
And Bingo, you'll see that was GitHub. Copy the URL in this. The next row just simply appends security to the end of it, and so I just click on that link that might. That way we test the link, we're happy.
Project Lead 2 minutes 32 seconds
That has actually gone to the right place, and in this particular case, if there's no published security advisories, I'll copy that across. However, in a case like this one.

Has moments of needing to do work, but unless something goes wrong, you know he's probably got six hours a day that he doesn't have to work and and it's hard to predict when things are going to go wrong so.

Project Lead

Project Lead 33 minutes 45 seconds
Oh oh.
Project Lead 33 minutes 48 seconds

None.
Technical Lead 33 minutes 52 seconds
He's not really.
Technical Lead 33 minutes 55 seconds
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And 'cause, I am now looking after a triple CI can juggle if I need to, and if he gets pulled into a problem, then I'll let you know and we'll have to go back to the manual process.

Alex.
Project Lead 34 minutes 2 seconds
Yeah.
Project Lead 34 minutes 6 seconds
Yeah. No, that's fine. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So look, we might have to just do a little bit, just help push it along a bit. But as I said, I was sort of just getting up to item 284. So it only says so at least when we sort of say something is, well, it's only.
AL
Technical Lead
34 minutes 16 seconds34:16

Hmm.

Project Lead 34 minutes 26 seconds
200 items to go and what I'm what? And I've been doing it, but all the meetings would be sitting in. I've been doing those even on other client meetings just to keep it just just to keep it moving.
AL

Technical Lead 34 minutes 28 seconds
None.
Technical Lead 34 minutes 35 seconds
Yeah.
Technical Lead 34 minutes 41 seconds
Yeah, some of it. I have the ones and do other stuff and others, we need you. It's sometimes it's just for information. So you know what the Hell's?

Project Lead
34 minutes 48 seconds34:48
Project Lead 34 minutes 48 seconds
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's more for, yeah, more just pure intelligence as to what's happening in the background. Yeah. Yeah, no, totally get it. Totally get it. Like. And hopefully when I interjected in that Citrix 1.

MMM.
Technical Lead 34 minutes 58 seconds

Project Lead 35 minutes 6 seconds
Yes, like I'm not sure if Elvis necessarily appreciate, appreciate appreciates it, but at least I can bring some of my own, my own Citrix experience to the table at least be a senator, at least be a sanity check. And I'm just saying, yeah, look, as long as it's.
AL
Technical Lead
35 minutes 16 seconds35:16
Technical Lead 35 minutes 16 seconds
Yeah.

Project Lead
35 minutes 22 seconds35:22
Project Lead 35 minutes 22 seconds
You know 95%, right? Unless it's something that's really got us grab us as strangle us. I can. I'll just leave it alone.
AL
Technical Lead
35 minutes 29 seconds35:29
Technical Lead 35 minutes 29 seconds
Hmm.
Technical Lead 35 minutes 31 seconds
Oh yeah, yeah. And you know, Angela likes hearing that you're OK with whatever we're proposing.

Project Lead
35 minutes 33 seconds35:33
Project Lead 35 minutes 33 seconds
Method.
Project Lead 35 minutes 39 seconds
Yeah, yeah. I don't know what what it is in that. It's a bit disconcerting.
AL
Technical Lead
35 minutes 49 seconds35:49
Technical Lead 35 minutes 49 seconds
Yeah, I I find it a bit amusing because as if we would propose something that you went no way.

Project Lead
35 minutes 49 seconds35:49
Project Lead 35 minutes 49 seconds
You want.
Project Lead 35 minutes 56 seconds
Yeah, yeah, no. When it was, who was it in the past when we were? Who is it the Citrix?
AL
Technical Lead
36 minutes 5 seconds36:05
Technical Lead 36 minutes 5 seconds
Oh yeah, Amit.

Project Lead
36 minutes 6 seconds36:06
Project Lead 36 minutes 6 seconds
Yeah. It's just like, oh, God. Oh, we bought the arpit with all the problems with profiles and everything like that. I think they appreciated someone else's. Been there and done that, or at least go someone to call ******** anyway.
AL
Technical Lead
36 minutes 9 seconds36:09
Technical Lead 36 minutes 9 seconds
No, I'll Pete, I'll Pete.
Technical Lead 36 minutes 18 seconds
Yeah.
Technical Lead 36 minutes 22 seconds
Yeah, you know, they wanted him put him back on the account and we and Robert and I said no.

Project Lead
36 minutes 25 seconds36:25
Project Lead 36 minutes 25 seconds
But.
Project Lead 36 minutes 29 seconds
Good move. Good move. No much better.
AL
Technical Lead
36 minutes 30 seconds36:30
Technical Lead 36 minutes 30 seconds
Which is why we got Elvis. As we said, they wouldn't accept him.

Project Lead
36 minutes 35 seconds36:35
Project Lead 36 minutes 35 seconds
Much, much better choice. Much better choice. Elvis can be a little bit intense, but I can I'd rather intense rather than over incompetent.
AL
Technical Lead
36 minutes 38 seconds36:38
Technical Lead 36 minutes 38 seconds
Yeah, yeah.
Technical Lead 36 minutes 46 seconds
Hmm. Yeah, that's right.
Technical Lead 36 minutes 48 seconds
Mm-hmm.

Project Lead
36 minutes 48 seconds36:48
Project Lead 36 minutes 48 seconds
And if there's anything I wouldn't go and hang, I wouldn't hang him out to dry in a meeting anyway. I'll just go look. Linda. Hey, I've seen this. Blah, blah, blah. And we just do it offline and go. Oh, yeah, but.
AL
Technical Lead
36 minutes 57 seconds36:57

No, all good. All right, let's see what Sean comes up with. And I'm just gonna go and have some lunch and come back from lunch and get into. Yeah. And just get this.
AL
Technical Lead
37 minutes 5 seconds37:05
Technical Lead 37 minutes 5 seconds
All right.
Technical Lead 37 minutes 9 seconds
Hmm.
Technical Lead 37 minutes 15 seconds
Do the monthly report.
Technical Lead 37 minutes 18 seconds
Oh, that's what I've got to do is ask for that login report. It's a bit useless, but I have to want it so I'll get it from him. That's OK. Don't worry about it. I know what you just reminded me.

Project Lead
37 minutes 18 seconds37:18
Project Lead 37 minutes 18 seconds
OK.
Project Lead 37 minutes 25 seconds
OK.
Project Lead 37 minutes 31 seconds
Yeah. Oh, OK. No, that's all right. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but I'll go. I'll say it's a good thing.
AL
Technical Lead
37 minutes 33 seconds37:33
Technical Lead 37 minutes 33 seconds
Yeah.
Technical Lead 37 minutes 39 seconds
Yes, alright. Thanks. Enjoy your lunch. I'll go and do something similar.
